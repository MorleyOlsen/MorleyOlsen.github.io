<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm an incoming master student at SIGS, THU, advised by Prof. Wenming Yang. Previously, I was focusing on the interdisciplinary applications of both Agriculture and Artificial Intelligence, and I will receive my bachelor's degree at CIEE, CAU. Standing at the forefront of AI, I want to power up various industries, revolutionizing the way people live.

My research interests include Computer Vision, AI for Science, Large Language Models, etc. I am now actively looking for **both research and entrepreneurial internships concerning AI models**! Feel free to contact with me through email!

My Chinese CV can be found at [here](docs/CV-cn.pdf)!
