<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm an incoming master student at SIGS, THU, advised by Prof. Wenming Yang. Previously, I was focusing on the interdisciplinary applications of both Agriculture and Artificial Intelligence, and I will receive my bachelor's degree at CIEE, CAU. Standing at the forefront of AI, I want to power up various industries, revolutionizing the way people live.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Multi-modal Large Language Models, etc. I am now actively looking for **internships and collaborations concerning MLLM/LLM**! Feel free to contact with me through email!
