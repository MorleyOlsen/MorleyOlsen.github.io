<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a master student at SIGS, THU, advised by Prof. [Wenming Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vsE4nKcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Prior to that, I have received my bachelor's degree at CIEE, CAU. Previously, I was focusing on the interdisciplinary applications of both Agriculture and Artificial Intelligence. Standing at the forefront of AI, I want to power up various industries, revolutionizing the way people live.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Multi-modal Large Language Models, Generative Models, etc. I am now actively looking for **internships and collaborations** in these fields! Feel free to contact with me through email(morleyolsen at foxmail dot com)!
